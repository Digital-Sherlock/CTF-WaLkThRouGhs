As the name suggets, here you'll find Python scripts I wrote for various purposes: challenges, CTFs, projects, target's enumeration and escalation, etc.
You may encounter these scripts within the other sections of the OSCP-toolbox, but I've decided to put them all here as well in case you are interested solely in Python.
