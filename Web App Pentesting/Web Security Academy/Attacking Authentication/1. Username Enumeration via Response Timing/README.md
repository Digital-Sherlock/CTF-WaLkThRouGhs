# Username Enumeration via Response Timing

## Username Enumeration

---

1. Capture the request to the login page via Burp Suite.

2. Verify that you're unable to make requests more than three times before login blocking.

3. Set the [X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) HTTP header to a random IP-address and come back to step three.

_**X-Forwarded-For** HTTP header enables user's location tracking via IP-address. Constantly switching the value will evade IP-based brute-force protection._

4. Capture the request again and direct it to Intruder.

5. Add the octet of the IP-address of the X-Forwarded-For field as well as username field to the Payload Positions and set the password value to a long random string ([python script](https://github.com/Digital-Sherlock/OSCP-Toolbox/blob/master/Web%20App%20Pentesting/Web%20Security%20Academy/Attacking%20Authentication/1.%20Username%20Enumeration%20via%20Response%20Timing/random_string.py)).

Setting a long password length will ensure the location of the password in the database will take some time. Hence, the correct username can be identified via long response time.

6. Start the attack and identify the longest 'Response Received' value upon attack completion.

7. Start new attack with the enumerated username and set of provided passwords.
