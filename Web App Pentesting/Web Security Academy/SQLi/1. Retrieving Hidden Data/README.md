The query used by the database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```

How to get all the products released and unreleased?

**Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--**

Now the query will look like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category =' OR 1=1-- AND released = 1
```
