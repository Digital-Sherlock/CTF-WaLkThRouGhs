This is a collection of tools, resources, and write-ups dedicated to the OSCP certification exam. The information is organized into sections such as "Tips and Resources", "Buffer Overflow", "Linux PE", etc.
The repository will be growing along the way with my preparation, and I hope the information you find here will be helpful.
